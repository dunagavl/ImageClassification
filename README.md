# ImageClassification
Machine learning algorithm which predicts the emotional state of pictured subjects
Image Classification Project for Emotion Detection
Overview
This project develops a deep learning model to classify images of faces based on emotional expressions, specifically distinguishing between 'Happy' and 'Sad' emotions. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN), OpenCV for image preprocessing, and Matplotlib for visualizations.

Technology Stack
Python: Primary programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks used for model creation, training, and evaluation.
OpenCV: For handling image file operations.
Matplotlib: For plotting training and validation results, and displaying images.

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
Prepare the Data: Organize your images in the data/ directory under happy and sad subdirectories.
Train the Model: Open and run the Jupyter Notebook ImageClassification.ipynb to train the model. This notebook contains steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance can be evaluated on a test set within the notebook.
Making Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data. Code for making predictions is also provided in the notebook.
Visualize Results: The training and validation accuracy and loss graphs are plotted in the notebook.
Features
Image Preprocessing: Images are preprocessed and normalized to fit the model's input requirements.
Model Architecture: The CNN is built with several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.
Training Visualizations: Training progress is visualized in real-time to monitor accuracy and loss metrics.
Model Evaluation: Precision, recall, and accuracy metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance.
Predictions: The model can classify new images into 'happy' or 'sad' categories.
